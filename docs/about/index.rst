**Ortho**\logy inference using **H**\idden **M**\arkov **M**\odels (**OrthoHMM**) was developed as
part of `Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_'s post-doctoral work. 

Inferring orthology (that is, genes that have shared ancestry) is a major challenge in bioinformatics.
This challenge is exacerbated when sequence divergence is high -- for example, among organisms that
began diverging dozens of millions of years ago -- which makes remote homology difficult to detect.

A popular approach to identify orthology utilizes graph theory. Specifically, an all-to-all comparison
of sequence similarity is conducted using BLAST or DIAMOND and the resulting similarity scores are used
to cluster groups of highly similar sequences together. The resulting groups of sequences are putative
orthologs; thus, these genes are termed orthologous groups of genes (or orthogroups).

Here, we introduce OrthoHMM, which implements Hidden Markov Models to infer orthology. Hidden Markov Models
have a distinct advantage over BLAST and DIAMOND because HMMs incoporate position-specific information
and patterns that enable more sensitivity and specificity for remote homolog detection. Benchmarking
reveals that OrthoHMM outperforms other software for orthology inference.
