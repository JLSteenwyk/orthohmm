# Benchmark Workflows

## Production OrthoHMM performance harness

Use the production CLI benchmark harness for runtime and memory measurements:

```bash
python benchmark_tools/benchmark_production.py \
  bacterial_scaling/subsets/n005 \
  /tmp/orthohmm_n005 \
  /tmp/orthohmm_n005.metrics.json \
  --cpu 32
```

The JSON records exact commands, input/output checksums, stage wall time,
sampled process-tree RSS, search candidates, significant hits, graph edges,
and orthogroup counts. The bacterial SLURM runner uses this harness rather
than maintaining a second OrthoHMM implementation.

## OrthoFinder comparator

This directory pins the OrthoFinder comparator to version 3.1.5 and keeps new
results separate from the historical 2.5.5 outputs.

## Installation

```bash
benchmark_tools/install_orthofinder.sh
```

The installer verifies the upstream archive checksum and the installed version.
Set `SOFTWARE_ROOT` or pass an explicit installation directory when the shared
workspace layout is unavailable.

## Benchmarks

Submit the serialized OrthoBench and QfO workflow with:

```bash
benchmark_tools/submit_orthofinder_v3_benchmarks.sh
```

The QfO runner writes both raw native OrthoFinder pairs (`pairs.tsv`) and pairs
whose IDs occur in the QfO mapping (`pairs.qfo.tsv`). Only the filtered file is
submitted to the official assessment pipeline. The scoring workflow retains
VGNC, SwissTrees, TreeFam-A, EC, GO, and FAS.

Useful environment overrides include `ORTHOFINDER_BIN`, `SOFTWARE_ROOT`,
`ORTHOBENCH_ROOT`, `QFO_PIPELINE`, `QFO_MAPPING`, `NEXTFLOW_BIN`, and
`JAVA_HOME_17`. Set `RESUME=1` when retrying an interrupted QfO assessment so
Nextflow reuses completed tasks instead of deleting its work directory.

Summarize completed QfO assessments with:

```bash
python benchmark_tools/qfo_summarize_scores.py \
  qfo_benchmark/scoring/orthofinder_v3_diamond
```
